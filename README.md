# social_media_api
  

## Description

![alt text](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue )


In this project I have developed the code for a server-based app that allows the user with interact with an social media style database via PostMan or Insomnia.
This was accomplished by using mondoDB along with the mongoose package.  
This project was a good way to even further develop my skills in the backend on my way to becoming a fullstack developer. 
The app also serves the functional purpose of being something very similar to the skills I would need to help my current job develop a parts database.
